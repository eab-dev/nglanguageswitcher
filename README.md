# Netgen Language Switcher
Netgen Language Switcher is an extension that provides another way of generating links for language switcher in eZ Publish.
Original language switcher generates URLs with `/switchlanguage/to/` module view, which is not really SEO friendly. This
extension mitigates that problem by generating correct full URLs to each siteaccess variant of current page.
